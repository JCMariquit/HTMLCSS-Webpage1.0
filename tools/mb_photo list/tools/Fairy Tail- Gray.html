		<h2 style="color: white;">Gray Fullbuster is the love interest of Juvia Lockser in the anime/manga series, Fairy Tail. Initially, Juvia was Gray's enemy, as a member of Phantom Lord's strongest team, Element 4. However, When the two met, she instantly fell in love with him at first sight. Also, Gray is quite skilled in acting as an evil person, as shown in year X792, when he infiltrated Avatar on Erza's request, something that manages to prompt Briar to remark Gray's desire for "revenge" against E.N.D. has stained both his soul and skin.</h2>
